# ☁️ 90-Day Cloud Security Engineer Roadmap  

## Phase 1: Foundations (Week 1–3)  
**Goal:** Build core IT & security fundamentals with a cloud-first mindset.  

### Week 1  
- Review networking basics: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S, firewalls, VPNs.  
- Learn Linux administration (users, permissions, SSH, logs).  
- Intro to cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP (account creation & free tiers).  

### Week 2  
- Cloud fundamentals: Compute (EC2/VMs), Storage (S3/Blob), Networking (VPC/VNet).  
- Study Identity & Access Management (IAM, roles, policies).  
- Security basics: CIA triad, shared responsibility model.  

### Week 3  
- Learn scripting: Bash, PowerShell, Python basics.  
- Encryption concepts: KMS, TLS, hashing, data-at-rest/in-transit security.  
- **Project:** Deploy a secure web app in AWS/Azure with IAM roles + security groups.

## Phase 2: Cloud Security Core (Week 4–6)  
**Goal:** Understand security monitoring & compliance in cloud.  

### Week 4  
- Logging & monitoring: AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, GCP Cloud Logging.  
- Explore GuardDuty (AWS), Security Center (Azure), SCC (GCP).  
- **Mini-Project:** Enable CloudTrail & detect user login anomalies.  

### Week 5  
- Cloud networking security:  
  - Security groups vs firewalls.  
  - VPC peering & Transit Gateway basics.  
  - Zero Trust networking concepts.  
- Study cloud threat models (misconfigured S3 bucket, over-permissive IAM).  

### Week 6  
- **Project:** Secure an S3 bucket or Blob storage (encryption, IAM, logging).  
- Automate security checks with AWS Config or Azure Policy.  
- Compliance basics: SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF, GDPR (high-level overview).  

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Cloud Security & Projects (Week 7–9)  
**Goal:** Hands-on with detection, response, and automation.  

### Week 7  
- Container & Kubernetes security: RBAC, pod security policies, network policies.  
- Tools: Falco, Aqua, Twistlock basics.  
- **Project:** Deploy secure Kubernetes cluster with RBAC & secrets management.  

### Week 8  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security: Terraform basics, policy-as-code.  
- Tools: Checkov, tfsec, Sentinel.  
- **Project:** Write Terraform to deploy a secure VPC + enforce security guardrails.  

### Week 9  
- Incident response in cloud:  
  - Investigate IAM key leakage.  
  - Respond to compromised VM.  
  - Use forensic tools (AWS Detective, Azure Sentinel).  
- **Project:** Simulate compromised IAM account & investigate logs.  

---

## Phase 4: Career Prep (Week 10–12)  
**Goal:** Build portfolio, validate skills, and prepare for job roles.  

### Week 10  
- Build GitHub repo of your cloud security projects.  
- Write LinkedIn/blog posts about your hands-on labs.  
- Learn basics of threat intelligence for cloud (attack surface, MITRE ATT&CK cloud matrix).  

### Week 11  
- Mock interview prep:  
  - Explain shared responsibility model.  
  - Troubleshoot a misconfigured bucket.  
  - Design a secure cloud architecture.  
- Practice whiteboarding secure cloud solutions.  

### Week 12  
- Take practice tests for AWS Security Specialty / AZ-500 / GCP Security Engineer.  
- Apply to **Cloud Security Engineer / Associate Security Engineer** roles.  
- Keep refining lab & add advanced projects (multi-cloud security).
